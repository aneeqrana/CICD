Developer Environment (local pc)
setup wordpress on docker container with docker compose file 

run 
docker-compose up -d 

once done get inside the docker container to setup git on the app 

docker ps 

copy wordpress app container ID 

docker exec -it containerID bash

once in install git on the server 

apt-get update && apt-get install -y git  now your docker container has been setup to push and pull from git now follow the git file to setup git on the container 


Dockerize the app on the server 

Now on the EC2 server install docker from scratch as on the local machine I already had docker desktop installed so I only need to run docker compose to setup the application but on the instance I don't have docker so to do that we will run the command 

sudo apt-get install docker.io

this will install docker on the machine to test if it is running run the command 
docker version 
this will display the information for the server and client 

to make docker run the commands without error we need to give docker the permissions to run commands 

sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER


to install docker compose on the server 

mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.3.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose

chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose


docker compose version



once all done run the command 

docker compose up -d 


or the other way around is to create a Dockerfile 

    Create a new directory for your Dockerfile and copy the WordPress files into it.

    Create a Dockerfile in the directory with the following content:


FROM php:7.4-apache

COPY . /var/www/html/

RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/

EXPOSE 8000



    Build the Docker image using the following command:

docker build -t wordpress .

    Run the Docker container using the following command:


docker run -p 8000:80 -d wordpress
